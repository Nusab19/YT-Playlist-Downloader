# Youtube Playlist Downloader

## Description

This is a simple python script to download youtube playlist videos. It uses the `pytube` library to download the videos.

## WHY?

I often find myself in a situation where I want to download a playlist from youtube. I have tried many online tools but they are either slow or have a lot of ads. So I decided to make a simple script to download the videos.
